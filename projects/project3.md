# Project 3
## Create a website for yourself

### Create an HTML Document with the following tags

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
1. `<html>` and `</html>`
1. `<head>` and `</head>`
1. `<body>` and `</body>`

The tags need to be in the right places
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top
- The `<html>` next
- The `<head>` and `<body>` tags should be inside the `<html>`
- Everything you want to see on the page should be inside the `<body>`

2. ### Save it as a new file called `Project3.html`
3. ### Add an `<h1>` tag with your name
4. ### Add a paragraph tag (`<p>`) and write a paragraph about yourself.
5. ### Make an unordered list (`<ul>`) of your favorite things. This list should include at least 3 list items (`<li>`)
6. ### Add a button (`<button>`) that says `Learn more`
