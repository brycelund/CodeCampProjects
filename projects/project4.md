# Project 4
## Make a link

### Create an HTML Document with the following tags

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
1. `<html>` and `</html>`
1. `<head>` and `</head>`
1. `<body>` and `</body>`

The tags need to be in the right places
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top
- The `<html>` next
- The `<head>` and `<body>` tags should be inside the `<html>`
- Everything you want to see on the page should be inside the `<body>`

2. ### Save it as a new file called `Project4.html`
3. ### Add an `<h1>` tag that says `Go to Google`
4. ### Add a link tag (`<a>`) and give it a title of `Google`. [Learn how to make a link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
