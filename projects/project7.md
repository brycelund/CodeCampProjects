# Project 7

## Animal Website (continued)

### Making it look pretty

We're going to learn a new tag.

`<div>`

The div tag is used to create sections of your website.

Add three sections to your website:

    Header (Name of the website)

    Content (Info about your animal)

    Footer (Who wrote the website. You!)

You won't name these sections. You'll just make 3 `<div>` tags inside the `<body>`. Inside each one you'll put the following:

#### Header

1. Your `<h1>` tag My Animal Website
1. Your `<h2>` tag with your animal name

#### Content

1. Your `<p>` tag with your information about your animal
1. The image of your animal

#### Footer

1. A `<p>` tag with your name

---

From here, it is up to you to learn the following concepts:

1. Style Classes. (We already learned how to use styles, now learn how to make a class)
   #### [Learn classes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_classes.asp)
   Now give each div a different class. The class names should be the names of the sections.
1. #### [Learn more styles](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
1. #### [Learn more about HTML divs](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp)
1. #### [Learn how to add Google fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started#overview)
   Find a font you like and add it to your website
