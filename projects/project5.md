### Create an HTML Document with the following tags

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
1. `<html>` and `</html>`
1. `<head>` and `</head>`
1. `<body>` and `</body>`

The tags need to be in the right places
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the top
- The `<html>` next
- The `<head>` and `<body>` tags should be inside the `<html>`
- Everything you want to see on the page should be inside the `<body>`
