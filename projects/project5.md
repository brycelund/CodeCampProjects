## We will be making a website about an animal. Choose any animal for this project.

1. ### Add an `<h1>` tag to the `<body>`. This will be the name of the website. Call it My Animal Fact Website.
1. ### Add an `<h2>` tag next. This will be our subtitle. Inside the `<h2>` write the name of the animal you chose.
1. ### Add a `<p>` tag. This is a paragraph tag where you can write some information about your animal. Inside the `<p>` write where the animal lives.
1. ### Now we are going to add an image on our website.
  - Go to [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com)
  - Search for a picture of your animal.
  - Choose the one you want and click on it.
  - Now right click on the picture and choose "Copy image address" or "Copy image URL"
1. ### Go back to your code. Add an `<img>` tag. We add the image to the `<img>` tag like this:
  - ``` <img src="url" /> ```
1. ### Replace url in the code above with the URL you just copied.
