# Kids Who Code Projects

The goal is to create about 20 small projects that gradually build on the skills they've learned previously to help them get a good footing with HTML and Javascript.

New concepts should be introduced gradually and links to the appropriate w3schools page should be provided as new concepts are introduced.

The initial projects will deal entirely with HTML helping them learn how to put content on a page, then we'll move over into CSS to style the pages, then javascript and teach them how to use javascript to do basic functions, conditionals, loops etc.

Then the final projects will be merging HTML, CSS, and Javascript to have them manipulate the DOM using Javascript.


## Projects

1. Setup a correctly formatted HTML page (doctype, html, head, and body tags) with their name in an h1 tag in the body.
1. Similar to project one except I don't give them the html to copy. They have to write it.
1. Setup a correctly formatted HTML page (doctype, html, head, and body tags) with an h1 tag, paragraph tag with a paragraph about themselves, a list of their favorite things, and a button.
1. Setup a link to take you to a different website. (Introduce HTML Attributes)
1. Setup a correctly formatted HTML page (doctype, html, head, and body tags) with at least 5 different tags in the body including an image tag (Let them search w3 schools for the list). Change the title of the webpage in the head tag.
1. Write at least two CSS classes to change the font color and the background color and apply them to two different tags in the body. (Introduce CSS)
